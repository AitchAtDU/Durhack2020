# Video Script
## Criteria
The purpose of the video is to showcase what you’ve learned, so if your hack isn’t complete and perfectly 
polished, that’s fine! Run us through the following things:
1. What you set out to do
2. How you set out to do it
3. If you’ve entered your challenge for a sponsor prize, show how you’ve taken the criteria into account
4. What worked/ what didn’t work
5. What you learned throughout the process
Hit all these points, and you’re golden!

## Script for project video

The idea behind our hack was to create a web application that can provide students
with an anonymous and safe environment to ask questions and give feedback about a lecture.

Many students feel intimadated in large zoom calls to ask the crucial questions that
could be the key to understanding a project. Many lecturers use office hours to solve this
to this however office hours have their own problems like being restricted to a certain time
of day every week that students might not be able to make.

Our application, feedback of dreams, will let students view the powerpoint for a lecture (or a lecture
recording) and ask questions that correspond to specific slides / timestamps. These questions are sent directly
to the lecturer and optionally anonymously posted to a forum board where students can view,
comment and like. The lecturer can then manage all questions posted for a lecture
and post answers on the forum that all students can see. Alongside asking questions, students will also
be able to rate how clearly they understand the contents of a slide using a traffic light system. This data
will be sent to the lecturer so that they know what parts of the lecture they may need to go over in more 
detail. To encourage engagement between students and lectures, asking questions and providing feedback could
be gameified for example yo ulevel up your profile for every comment you provide. 
Many algorithms can be used to enhance this experience, one idea our group had was to use a NLP
algorithm to analyse the question the user is about to ask and suggest similar questions that other users
have asked that may have been answered

To accomplish this, we set out to create a series webpages using bootstrap connected by a
nodejs server. We would encorporate a database into this server that would allow users to log in using a whirlpool
encrypted logon system that takes their durham email and password. Teachers would be given access to create classes of
students that can view the slideshows that they can upload onto the webserver
**someone else provide more technicalities on how we set out to do the backend pls**

We created the building blocks of our project. By the end of the hackathon the homepage was functional,
we had a suitable database and a nodejs web server hosted on AWS. Our group was learning web development
from scratch while creating our project. Admittedly our project idea was too ambitious given the skill set of our group
and the time constraint of a hackathon. Eventhough we never got a working solution that we set out to create
we are confident in the idea and we tried are best

We've all learned many key skills involved in the web development process including but not limited to: how to collaborate
using GIT, using bootstrap and CSS to create a clean looking webpage and hosting a back end server using AWS. As well as this,
we've all learned what it's like to collaborate on large project and what to expect from a hackathon. Thank you so much for the
experience and we're looking forward to seeing the winning project.
